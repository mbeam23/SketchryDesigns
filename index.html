<p class="text1">The gallery is home to a wide variety of work I have done during my time as a student, but also things I have designed for fun or practice and happened to really enjoy the outcome. It contains everything from package design and corporate rebranding, concept art and app design, and even photography. The work you find here are some of my best pieces and it will be updated regularly .</p>
