<h1 class="Abouttitle">A few fun facts about myself</h1>
    <p class="introtext2">I am a 24 year old digital artist from Niagara Falls, Ontario. I have lived in Niagara Falls my entire life, only having moved once to date. I have a degree in Journalism and Graphic Design, and I won the 2017 Emerge Media Award in the category of Multimedia Production for a collaborative project called Crisis on Campus. I spend most of my time drawing on my iPad and exploring what can be done with new brushes. I play video games like itâ€™s my life and I have a love for coffee and loose leaf tea.
      <br>
      <br>
The furthest I have travelled to date is Europe, specifically London.  Fantasy and history are my jams, especially when the two are combined. My favourite number is 23 and I was born on the cusp of Libra and Scorpio. One of goals in life is to one day publish a novel.
 <br>
 <br>
 Since my early years I knew I wanted to go into a career involving art. I originally started out my college days in Game Development, but quickly realize that unlike coding for a website, coding for the video game world was not the career for me.
 <br>
 <br>
I am also an avid aquarist. I currently have 8 aquariums filled with a wide variety of fish; from tropical to puffer fish, goldfish and even shrimp, and I am the proud mom of an incredibly vocal Lovebird named Rico.
